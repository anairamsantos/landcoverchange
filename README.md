Land use mapping techniques are becoming increasingly used and therefore need to be 
constantly improved. Thus, some limitations of the use of multispectral images have been 
discovered. The present project aimed to compare two classification models (Random Forest 
and Support Vector Machine) using SAR data and combining them with multispectral indices 
such as NDVI, NDWI NDMI, EVI and BSI. The trained classification algorithms presented a 
reasonable performance, depending on the data set used, that is, aggregating multispectral 
data, evidenced by the limited performance of the Support Vector Machine model, an 
unsatisfactory performance for classification.
